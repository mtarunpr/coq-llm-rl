Theorem silly1 : forall (n m : nat),
  n = m ->
  n = m.

Proof.
(* The theorem is an identity, so we can use the "reflexivity" tactic, which
     completes the proof by applying the equality axiom (n = n) to the goal.
*)

Lemma nat_equality_reflexivity_0 : forall n m : nat, n = m -> n = m.

Proof.
(* The "intros" tactic is used to introduce all the variables in the
     statement.
In this case, it will introduce n, m, and the equality proof H.
*)
  intros n m H.
(* Now we simply apply the axiom of reflexivity to the equality proof H.
This will produce a proof that n is equal to n, which is exactly what we
     need to prove our lemma.

Lemma nat_equality_reflexivity_1 : forall n m : nat, forall H : n = m, n = m.

Proof.
(* The goal is to prove the statement for any natural numbers n and m, 
     and the equality H that n = m.
Since equality is reflexive in Coq, 
     we can simply apply the equality type constructor to H to obtain n = m.
*)
  intros n m H.
reflexivity.
(* This tactic applies the equality type constructor to H, 
     which is the equality proof we have.
This completes the proof.

Lemma nat_equality_reflexivity_3 : forall n m : nat, forall H : n = m, n = m.

Proof.
(* The proof of this lemma is very simple.
We just need to apply the axiom of reflexivity
     for equality.
This axiom states that for any type T and any element x of T, x is equal
     to x.
In our case, T is the type of natural numbers, and x is n.
The axiom can be
     applied to our goal by instantiating T with nat and x with n.
