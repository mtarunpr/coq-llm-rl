Proof.
(* We will proceed by induction on the count argument of the repeat function.
*)
  induction 2 as [|n' IHn'].
- (* Base case: count = 0 *)
    (* We need to prove that repeat nat 4 0 = nil nat *)
    reflexivity.
- (* Inductive case: count = S n' *)
    (* We need to prove that repeat nat 4 (S n') = cons nat 4 (repeat nat 4 n') *)
    (* By the IHn', we know that repeat nat 4 n' = cons nat 4 (repeat nat 4 n').
Now we just need to prove that *)
    (* cons nat 4 (repeat nat 4 n') = cons nat 4 (cons nat 4 (repeat nat 4 n')).
This is true by definition of cons.
