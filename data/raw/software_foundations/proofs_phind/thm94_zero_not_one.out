Proof.
(* We will use the definition of inequality in Coq, which is defined as a negation of equality.
In other words, "0 <> 1" is the same as "~ (0 = 1)".
We will prove this by contradiction.
Assume "0 = 1".
Then, we have a contradiction with the axiom "0 <> S n" for any n.
This axiom states that no number is equal to the successor of that number.
So, we have "0 = S n" for some n, which contradicts "0 = 1".
Therefore, our assumption that "0 = 1" is false, and we have proved "0 <> 1".
