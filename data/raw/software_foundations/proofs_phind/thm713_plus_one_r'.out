Check nat_ind :
  forall P : nat -> Prop,
    P 0 ->
    (forall n : nat, P n -> P (S n)) ->
    forall n : nat, P n.





Theorem mul_0_r' : forall n:nat,
  n * 0 = 0.
Proof.
  apply nat_ind.
  -  reflexivity.
  -  simpl. intros n' IHn'. rewrite -> IHn'.
    reflexivity.  Qed.







Theorem plus_one_r' : forall n:nat,
  n + 1 = S n.

Proof.
(* Base case: n + 1 = S n for n = 0 *)
  intros n.
induction n as [|n' IHn'].
- (* n = 0 *)
    reflexivity.
- (* n = S n' *)
    simpl.
rewrite IHn'.
reflexivity.
Qed.
