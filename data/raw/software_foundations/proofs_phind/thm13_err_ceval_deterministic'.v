Theorem ceval_deterministic' : forall c st st1 st2,
  st =[ c ]=> st1  ->
  st =[ c ]=> st2 ->
  st1 = st2.

Proof.
(* The theorem to be proven is a statement about the behavior of the ceval function,
     which models the execution of a single instruction on a state.
The theorem states
     that if two states result from executing the same instruction on the same initial
     state, then these two resulting states must be equal.
*)

  (* We proceed by induction on the relation =[ c ]=>, which relates two states
     when executing a single instruction c results in the second state from the
     first.
*)
  intros c st st1 st2 H H'.
induction H as [|st0 Hrec].
- (* Base case: st =[ c ]=> st1.
*)
    (* In this case, we have st =[ c ]=> st1 and st =[ c ]=> st2.
Since st1 and st2
       are the same state resulting from executing c on st, they must be equal.
*)
    reflexivity.
- (* Inductive case: st =[ c ]=> st1 with st0 =[ c ]=> st1.
*)
    (* We have st0 =[ c ]=> st1 and st =[ c ]=> st2.
We need to prove st1 = st2.
*)
    (* We can use the induction hypothesis on Hrec, which is the inductive hypothesis
       for the relation =[ c ]=>, to prove st1 = st2.
*)
    apply Hrec.
(* The induction hypothesis requires us to prove st0 =[ c ]=> st2.
However, we
       only have st =[ c ]=> st2, not st0 =[ c ]=> st2.
We can use the premise H' to
       prove st0 =[ c ]=> st2.
*)
    apply H'.
(* This concludes the proof.
