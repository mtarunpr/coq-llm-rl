Theorem plus_leb_compat_l : forall n m p : nat,

In this case, we have p + 0 <=? p + m, which is true since 0 + p = p.

       Inductive case: n = S n'.
We know that S n' + p <=? S m + p = true.
We want to prove that n' + p <=? m + p = true.
By the definition of <=?, we know that S n' + p <=? S m + p is true iff n' + p < S m + p.
We can rewrite this as S n' + p < S m + p iff n' + p = m + p.
We can prove this by induction on p.
*)

(*
       Now we need to prove that n' + p = m + p -> n' + p < S m + p.
We can rewrite this as S n' + p = m + p -> S n' + p < S m + p.
By the definition of +, we know that S n' + p = m + p iff n' + p = m.
We can rewrite this as n' + p = m.
By the definition of <, we know that n' + p < S m + p iff n' + p = m.
So we have proved the theorem.

We want to prove that (p + 0 <=? p + S m') = true.
By the definition of <=?, this is equivalent to proving that (p + 0) + m' <= p + S m'.
By the IH, we know that (p + 0) + m' <= p + m'.
Now we need to prove that p + m' <= p + S m'.
By the definition of <=?, this is equivalent to proving that (p + S m') - p <= m'.
By the definition of addition, this is equivalent to proving that S m' <= m'.
But this is true by the induction hypothesis on m'.
Therefore, we have proved that (p + 0) + m' <= p + S m', and by the IH, (p + 0) + m' <= p + m'.
Hence, (p + 0) + m' <= p + S m', and by the definition of <=?, (p + 0 <=? p + S m') = true.
