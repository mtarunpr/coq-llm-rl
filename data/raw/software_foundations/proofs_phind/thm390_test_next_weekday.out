  destruct (next_weekday saturday) as d.
(* Now we have d = tuesday.
We will now prove that d = tuesday.

Lemma next_weekday_of_saturday_is_tuesday_0 : next_weekday (next_weekday saturday) = tuesday.

Proof.
(*
    To prove this lemma, we will use the definition of next_weekday and pattern matching.
We want to show that next_weekday (next_weekday saturday) is equal to tuesday.
We know that next_weekday saturday is equal to monday (from the definition of next_weekday).
So, we want to show that next_weekday monday is equal to tuesday.
This is true according to the definition of next_weekday.
