Lemma partial_function_empty_relation_0 : partial_function empty_relation.

Proof.
(* We will use the definition of partial function to prove that empty_relation is a partial function.
A function is a partial function iff for all x, there exists a unique y such that f x = y.
In the case of empty_relation, we have no constructors, so there are no possible values for f x.
Therefore, the uniqueness condition is vacuously satisfied, and we can conclude that empty_relation is a partial function.
*)
  intros.
(* We need to show that for all x, there exists a unique y such that empty_relation x y.
Since there are no constructors for empty_relation, this is vacuously true.
*)
  exists x.
(* We need to show that if empty_relation x y and empty_relation x z, then y = z.
Again, since there are no constructors for empty_relation, this is vacuously true.
*)
  intros.
(* We need to show that for all x, there exists a y such that empty_relation x y.
Since there are no constructors for empty_relation, this is vacuously true.

Lemma partial_function_empty_relation_1 : partial_function empty_relation.

Proof.
(* We need to prove that empty_relation is a partial function.
A relation is a partial function iff it is total or it is empty.
We will prove that empty_relation is empty, which implies that it is a partial function.
*)

  (* We will use the following lemma:
     Lemma: A relation R is empty iff for all x, y, R x y -> False.
Proof of Lemma:
       - If R is empty, then for all x, y, R x y -> False, because there are no pairs in R.
- If for all x, y, R x y -> False, then R is empty, because there are no pairs in R.
*)

  (* Now we prove that empty_relation is empty.
*)
  intros x y H.
(* H is the hypothesis that empty_relation x y.
*)
  contradiction.
(* We have assumed that empty_relation x y, and we now derive a contradiction.
