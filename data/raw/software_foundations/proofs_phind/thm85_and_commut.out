The correct statement would be:

     Lemma implies_transitivity_4 : forall P Q : Prop, P -> Q -> P /\ Q.
With this correct statement, we could finish the proof as follows:
  *)
  split.
- (* Proving P *)
    exact H.
- (* Proving Q *)
    (* We don't have any information about Q, so we can't make any progress here.
*)
Admitted.
```
Qed.
