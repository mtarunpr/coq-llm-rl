Theorem ev_plus4 : forall n, ev n -> ev (4 + n).

Proof.
(* The goal is to prove that for any natural number n, if n is even, then 4 + n is also even.
*)
  (* We will proceed by induction on n.
*)
  intros n Hn.
induction Hn as [| n' Hn' IHn'].
(* Base case: n = 0 *)
  - (* We know that ev 0 holds, so we need to prove ev 4.
We have this definition: *)
    exact ev_4'''.
(* Inductive case: n = S (S n') and ev (S (S n')) holds.
We need to prove ev (4 + S (S n')).
*)
  (* By definition of ev, we know that ev (S (S n')) = ev_SS n' (ev n').
*)
  (* We will use the induction hypothesis IHn' on (ev n').
*)
  - (* We have ev (S (S n')), and we need to prove ev (4 + S (S n')).
*)
    (* We know that 4 + S (S n') = S (S (S (S n'))) by Peano arithmetic.
*)
    (* We also know that ev (S (S n')) = ev_SS n' (ev n').
*)
    (* By the induction hypothesis IHn', we have ev (4 + n').
*)
    (* Therefore, we have ev_SS n' (ev (4 + n')).
*)
    (* By definition of ev_SS, we have ev (S (S (S (S n')))).
*)
    (* This proves the theorem for the inductive case.
*)
    apply ev_SS; assumption.
