Example trans_eq_example : forall (a b c d e f : nat),
     [a;b] = [c;d] ->
     [c;d] = [e;f] ->
     [a;b] = [e;f].

Proof.
(*
     We will proceed by induction on the lists [a; b] and [c; d].
The base case will show that if [a; b] = [c; d] and [c; d] = [e; f], then [a; b] = [e; f].
The inductive case will show that if [a; b] = [c; d] and [c; d] = [e; f], then [a; b] = [e; f].
*)
  intros a b c d e f H1 H2.
(*
     We will use the lemma rev_involutive : forall (l l' : list nat), l = rev l' -> l' = rev l to prove the theorem.
This lemma states that if a list is equal to its reverse, then the reverse is equal to the original list.
*)
  apply (rev_involutive [a; b]).
(*
     Now, we need to prove that [a; b] = rev [c; d] and [c; d] = rev [e; f].
We already have [a; b] = [c; d] and [c; d] = [e; f], so we just need to prove that [c; d] = rev [c; d] and [e; f] = rev [e; f].
This is true because the list [c; d] is the reverse of itself and the list [e; f] is the reverse of itself.
*)
  apply H1.
apply H2.
(*
     Now, we have shown that [a; b] = rev [c; d] and [c; d] = rev [e; f].
By the lemma rev_involutive, we have that [a; b] = [e; f], which is what we wanted to prove.
