Lemma and_example2' : forall n m : nat, n = 0 /\ m = 0 -> n + m = 0.

Proof.
(* The goal is to prove the lemma "and_example2'".
This lemma is of the form "forall n m : nat, n = 0 /\ m = 0 -> n + m = 0".
We will use the previously proven lemma "and_example2" to prove this new lemma.
The tactic "intros" is used to introduce the variables n and m and the hypothesis H: n = 0 /\ m = 0.
*)
  intros n m.
(* The tactic "destruct H as [H1 H2]" is used to destruct the hypothesis H into two separate hypotheses H1 and H2.
H1 will be "n = 0" and H2 will be "m = 0".
*)
  destruct H as [H1 H2].
(* Now we have H1: n = 0 and H2: m = 0.
We can use the previously proven lemma "and_example2" to prove our goal.
The tactic "apply" is used to apply the lemma "and_example2" with the variables n and m, and the hypotheses H1 and H2.
*)
  apply (and_example2 n m H1 H2).
(* The tactic "reflexivity" is used to conclude the proof.
It checks that the goal is a trivial equality and closes the proof.
*)
  reflexivity.
