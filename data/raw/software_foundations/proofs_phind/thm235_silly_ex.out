Proof.
(*
     We will proceed by induction on p.
The base case will show that if even 0 = true, then odd (S 0) = true.
The inductive step will show that if even p = true and odd (S p) = true, then even (S (S p)) = false.

(* We need to show that odd (S 0) = true.
By definition, odd 0 = false and even 0 = true.
Therefore, we need to show that odd 1 = true.
By the first hypothesis, H0, we have even 1 = false.
Therefore, by the second hypothesis, H1, we have odd 1 = true.
