Lemma addition_commutativity_lemma_1 : forall n m : nat, n + m = m + (n + 0).

Proof.
(*
    We will proceed by induction on n.
Base case: n = 0.
When n = 0, the left side of the equation is 0 + m, and the right side is m + (0 + 0) by the definition of addition.
Since 0 + 0 = 0 by add_0_r_firsttry, we have m + 0 = m, so m + (0 + 0) = m + 0 = m.
Inductive step: n + m = m + (n + 0).
Assume the statement holds for n.
We will show that it holds for S n.
The left side of the equation for S n + m is S (n + m) by the definition of addition.
The right side of the equation is m + (S n + 0) by the inductive hypothesis.
By plus_n_Sm, S (n + m) = n + (S m), so S (n + m) = n + (S m) = m + (n + 0) by the inductive hypothesis.

The right side of the equation is m + (S n' + 0) by the inductive hypothesis.
