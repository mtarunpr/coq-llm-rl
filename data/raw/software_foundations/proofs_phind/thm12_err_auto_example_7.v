Definition is_fortytwo x := (x = 42).



Example auto_example_7 : forall x,
  (x <= 42 /\ 42 <= x) -> is_fortytwo x.

Proof.
(* The theorem to be proven is of the form P -> Q, where P is a conjunction of two propositions.
The goal is to prove Q given P.
*)
  intros x H.
(* H is a conjunction of two propositions.
We can destruct it into its two components.
*)
  destruct H as [H1 H2].
(* Now we have H1: x <= 42 and H2: 42 <= x.
We want to prove is_fortytwo x, which is equivalent to x = 42.
*)
  (* To prove equality in Coq, we can use the reflexivity principle, which states that any term is equal to itself.
*)
  (* However, we have H1 and H2, which state that x is less than or equal to 42 and 42 is less than or equal to x, respectively.
*)
  (* We can use the le_antisym lemma, which states that if a number is less than or equal to another and the other is less than or equal to it, then they are equal.
*)
  (* We apply the le_antisym lemma with H1 and H2 as the arguments.
*)
  apply le_antisym in H1.
(* Now we have H1: x = 42.
This is exactly what we wanted to prove.
*)
  (* We can now use the equality proof we have to finish the proof.
*)
  exact H1.
