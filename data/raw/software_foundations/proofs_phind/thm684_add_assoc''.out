Theorem add_assoc'' : forall n m p : nat,

Proof.
(* We will use the previously proven lemmas and theorems to prove add_assoc''.

*)
  intros n m p.
(* We will use the induction principle for nat.
*)

- (* Base case: n = 0.
*)
    (* We know that 0 + m = m by add_0_r_firsttry.
*)
    (* Therefore, (0 + m) + p = m + p by associativity of addition.
*)
    (* And 0 + (m + p) = m + p by the previous step.
*)
    (* Thus, (n + m) + p = n + (m + p) for n = 0.

- (* Inductive case: n = S n'.
*)
    (* We will use the induction hypothesis IHn'.
*)
    (* We know that S n' + m = n' + (S m) by plus_n_Sm.
*)
    (* Therefore, (S n' + m) + p = (n' + (S m)) + p by the induction hypothesis.
*)
    (* By associativity of addition, this is equal to n' + ((S m) + p).
*)
    (* By the previous step, this is equal to n' + (m + (S p)).
*)
    (* Therefore, (S n' + m) + p = n' + (m + (S p)) for n = S n'.
