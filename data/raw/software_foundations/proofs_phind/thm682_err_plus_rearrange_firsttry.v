Proof.
(*
   * We will proceed by induction on n.
*
   * Base case: n = 0.
*   LHS: (0 + m) + (p + q)
   *   RHS: (m + 0) + (p + q)
   * Both sides are equal by the definition of addition.

(*
   * Inductive case: n = S n'.
*   LHS: (S n' + m) + (p + q)
   *   RHS: (m + S n') + (p + q)
   * We will use the induction hypothesis IHn' on the first part of the LHS and RHS.
* Then, we will use the associativity of addition to move the parentheses.
