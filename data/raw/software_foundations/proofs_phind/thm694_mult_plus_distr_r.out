Lemma multiplication_distributive_over_zero_0 : forall n m : nat, (n + m) * 0 = n * 0 + m * 0.

Proof.
(*
     We will proceed by induction on n.
Base case: n = 0.
(0 + m) * 0 = 0 * 0 + m * 0
         By the definition of multiplication, this is true.
Inductive step: n = S n'.
(S n' + m) * 0 = (S n' * 0) + (m * 0)
         By the induction hypothesis, we have:
         (n' + m) * 0 = n' * 0 + (m * 0)
         Now, we need to show that:
         (S (n' + m) * 0 = (S n' * 0) + (m * 0)
         By the definition of multiplication, we have:
         S ((n' + m) * 0) = S (n' * 0 + (m * 0))
         By the induction hypothesis, we have:
         S (n' * 0 + (m * 0)) = S (n' * 0) + S (m * 0)
         By the definition of addition, we have:
         S (n' * 0) + S (m * 0) = (n' * 0) + S (m * 0)
         By the definition of multiplication, we have:
         (n' * 0) + S (m * 0) = n' * 0 + (m * 0)
         So, the lemma holds for the case n = S n'.

Lemma zero_times_any_number_is_zero_4 : forall m : nat, m * 0 = m * 0.

Proof.
(* The goal is to prove that m * 0 = m * 0.
This is trivially true because multiplication
     by 0 is the identity for multiplication.
In other words, for any number m, m * 0 = 0.
*)
  intros m.
(* We apply the axiom "mul_0_r" which states that for any natural number n, n * 0 = 0.
*)
  apply mul_0_r.
