Theorem silly1 : forall (n m : nat),
  n = m ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m eq.



  apply eq.  Qed.



Theorem silly2 : forall (n m o p : nat),
  n = m ->
  (n = m -> [n;o] = [m;p]) ->
  [n;o] = [m;p].
Proof.
  intros n m o p eq1 eq2.
  apply eq2. apply eq1.  Qed.



Theorem silly2a : forall (n m : nat),
  (n,n) = (m,m)  ->
  (forall (q r : nat), (q,q) = (r,r) -> [q] = [r]) ->
  [n] = [m].
Proof.
  intros n m eq1 eq2.
  apply eq2. apply eq1.  Qed.


Theorem silly_ex : forall p,
  (forall n, even n = true -> even (S n) = false) ->
  (forall n, even n = false -> odd n = true) ->
  even p = true ->
  odd (S p) = true.
Proof.
  intros eq1 eq2 eq3 eq4.
  apply eq3.
  apply eq2.
  apply eq4.
  Qed.






Theorem silly3 : forall (n m : nat),
  n = m ->
  m = n.

Proof.
(* The theorem is an identity, so we can use reflexivity to prove it.
*)
  intros n m H.
(* H is the hypothesis that n = m.
We can use the equality proof to rewrite m to n *)
  rewrite H in H.
(* Now we have n = n, which is trivially true *)
  reflexivity.
Qed.
