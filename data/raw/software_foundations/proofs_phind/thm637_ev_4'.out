Theorem ev_4' : ev 4.

Proof.
(* We will use the induction principle for ev to prove ev_4'.
*)
  induction 4 as [ | n' IHn'].
- (* Base case: n = 0 *)
    (* We need to prove ev 0.
This is an axiom of our definition of ev, so we can just apply it.
*)
    apply ev_0.
- (* Inductive case: n = S (S n') *)
    (* We need to prove ev (S (S n')).
We will use the induction hypothesis IHn' for this.
*)
    apply ev_SS.
- (* We need to prove ev n'.
This is where the induction hypothesis comes in.
*)
