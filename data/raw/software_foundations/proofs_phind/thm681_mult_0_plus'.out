Lemma zero_addition_neutral_for_multiplication_0 : forall n : nat, (n + 0 + 0) * 0 = n * 0.

Proof.
(*
    We will proceed by induction on n.
Base case: n = 0.
LHS: (0 + 0 + 0) * 0 = 0 * 0 = 0.
RHS: 0 * 0 = 0.
Both sides are equal, so the base case holds.
Inductive step: n = S n'.
We will rewrite the goal using the induction hypothesis.
Goal: (S n' + 0 + 0) * 0 = S n' * 0.
By the induction hypothesis, we know that (n' + 0) * 0 = n' * 0.
We will now use the add_assoc lemma to associate the addition in the LHS.
(S n' + 0 + 0) * 0 = (S n' + 0) + 0 * 0 = S n' + (0 * 0).
By the add_0_r_firsttry lemma, we know that S n' + 0 = S n'.
So, we have S n' + (0 * 0) = S n'.
By the add_comm lemma, we can swap the terms to get S n' = S n' + (0 * 0).

We will need to use the induction hypothesis on n'.
LHS: (S n' + 0 + 0) * 0 = (S (n' + 0) + 0) * 0 = S (n' + 0) * 0.
By the induction hypothesis, we have (n' + 0) * 0 = n' * 0.

Lemma zero_addition_neutral_for_multiplication_0 : forall n : nat, (n + 0 + 0) * 0 = n * 0.

Proof.
(*
    We will proceed by induction on n.
Base case: n = 0.
LHS: (0 + 0 + 0) * 0 = 0 * 0 = 0.
RHS: 0 * 0 = 0.
Both sides are equal, so the base case holds.
Inductive step: n = S n'.
We will rewrite the goal using the induction hypothesis.
Goal: (S n' + 0 + 0) * 0 = S n' * 0.
By the induction hypothesis, we know that (n' + 0) * 0 = n' * 0.
We will now use the add_assoc lemma to associate the addition in the LHS.
(S n' + 0 + 0) * 0 = (S n' + 0) + 0 * 0 = S n' + (0 * 0).
By the add_0_r_firsttry lemma, we know that S n' + 0 = S n'.
So, we have S n' + (0 * 0) = S n'.
By the add_comm lemma, we can swap the terms to get S n' = S n' + (0 * 0).

Both sides are equal, so the base case holds.
Inductive step: n = S n'.
We will rewrite the goal using the induction hypothesis.
Goal: (S n' + 0 + 0) * 0 = S n' * 0.
By the induction hypothesis, we know that (n' + 0) * 0 = n' * 0.
We will now use the add_assoc lemma to associate the addition in the LHS.
(S n' + 0 + 0) * 0 = (S n' + 0) + 0 * 0 = S n' + (0 * 0).
By the add_0_r_firsttry lemma, we know that S n' + 0 = S n'.
So, we have S n' + (0 * 0) = S n'.
By the add_comm lemma, we can swap the terms to get S n' = S n' + (0 * 0).

Lemma zero_addition_neutral_for_multiplication_1 : forall n : nat, (n + 0 + 0) * 0 = n * 0.

Proof.
(*
    We will proceed by induction on n.
Base case: n = 0.
LHS: (0 + 0 + 0) * 0 = 0 * 0 = 0.
RHS: 0 * 0 = 0.
Both sides are equal, so the base case holds.
Inductive step: n = S n'.
We will need to use the induction hypothesis on n'.
LHS: (S n' + 0 + 0) * 0 = (S (n' + 0) + 0) * 0 = S (n' + 0) * 0.
By the induction hypothesis, we have (n' + 0) * 0 = n' * 0.
So, LHS = S (n' * 0) = S 0 = 0.
RHS: S n' * 0 = 0.
Both sides are equal, so the inductive step holds.
