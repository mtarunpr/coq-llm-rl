Lemma le_antisym : forall n m: nat, (n <= m /\ m <= n) -> n = m.
Proof. lia. Qed.



Lemma zero_is_unique_9 : forall m : nat, forall H : 0 <= 0 -> 0 <= m <= 0, forall contra_m : 0 <= 0, 0 = m.

Proof.
(* We will proceed by contradiction.
Assume m is not 0.
*)
  intros m H contra_m.
assert (H0 : 0 <= m) by apply H.
assert (H1 : m <= 0) by apply H.
(* We have H0 : 0 <= m and H1 : m <= 0.
We will derive a contradiction from these.
*)
  (* We will use the lemma le_antisym to prove the contradiction.
*)
  apply le_antisym in H0.
(* Now we have H0 : 0 = m.
But we have a hypothesis contra_m : 0 <= 0, which is absurd because 0 is not less than or equal to 0.
*)
  apply contra_m in H0.
(* Now we have H0 : 0 <= 0, which is absurd.
*)
  apply le_lt_irrefl in H0.
(* We have derived a contradiction, so we can conclude that our initial assumption (m is not 0) must be false.
*)
  (* Therefore, m must be 0.
*)
  exact H0.
