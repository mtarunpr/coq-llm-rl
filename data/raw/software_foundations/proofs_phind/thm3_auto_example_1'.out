Example auto_example_1 : forall (P Q R: Prop),
  (P -> Q) -> (Q -> R) -> P -> R.
Proof.
  intros P Q R H1 H2 H3.
  apply H2. apply H1. assumption.
Qed.





Example auto_example_1' : forall (P Q R: Prop),
  (P -> Q) -> (Q -> R) -> P -> R.

Proof.
(* The goal is to prove that if we have implications P->Q and Q->R, and we know P is true, then R must be true.
We will proceed by applying the implications in sequence.
*)
  intros P Q R Hpq Hqr Hp.
(* First, we apply the implication P->Q to Hp, which gives us Q.
*)
  apply Hpq in Hp.
(* Then, we apply the implication Q->R to the result Q, which gives us R.
*)
  apply Hqr in Hp.
(* Finally, we return R as the result of the proof.
*)
  exact Hp.
Qed.
