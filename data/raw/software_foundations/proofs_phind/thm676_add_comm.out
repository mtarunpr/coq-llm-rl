Theorem add_comm : forall n m : nat,
  n + m = m + n.

Proof.
(*
   * We will proceed by induction on m.
* Base case: m = 0.
*   We need to prove n + 0 = 0 + n.
*   By add_0_r_firsttry, we have n + 0 = n.
*   By add_0_r_firsttry with the arguments swapped, we have 0 + n = n.
*   Therefore, n + 0 = 0 + n.
* Inductive case: n + (S m) = S m + n.
*   We need to prove S(n + m) = S(m + n).
*   By the induction hypothesis, we have n + m = m + n.
*   By plus_n_Sm, we have S(n + m) = n + (S m).
*   By the induction hypothesis, we have S(m + n) = m + (S n).
*   Therefore, S(n + m) = S(m + n).
