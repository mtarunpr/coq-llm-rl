Theorem plus_leb_compat_l : forall n m p : nat,
  n <=? m = true -> (p + n) <=? (p + m) = true.

Proof.
(*
     We will proceed by induction on n.
Base case: n = 0.
In this case, we have p + 0 <=? p + m, which is true since 0 + p = p.
*)

- (* n = S n' *)
    (*
       Inductive case: n = S n'.
We know that S n' + p <=? S m + p = true.
We want to prove that n' + p <=? m + p = true.
By the definition of <=?, we know that S n' + p <=? S m + p is true iff n' + p < S m + p.
We can rewrite this as S n' + p < S m + p iff n' + p = m + p.
We can prove this by induction on p.
*)
    apply (plus_leb_compat_l n' m p H).
(*
       Now we need to prove that n' + p = m + p -> n' + p < S m + p.
We can rewrite this as S n' + p = m + p -> S n' + p < S m + p.
By the definition of +, we know that S n' + p = m + p iff n' + p = m.
We can rewrite this as n' + p = m.
By the definition of <, we know that n' + p < S m + p iff n' + p = m.
So we have proved the theorem.
