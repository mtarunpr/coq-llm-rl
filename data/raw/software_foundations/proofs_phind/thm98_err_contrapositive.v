Theorem contrapositive : forall (P Q : Prop),
  (P -> Q) -> (~Q -> ~P).

Proof.
(* The theorem to be proven is of the form (P -> Q) -> (~Q -> ~P).
This is a basic
     logical principle known as the contrapositive.
The contrapositive of a statement
     P -> Q is the equivalent statement ~Q -> ~P.
The proof will be constructed by
     applying the definition of implication and negation, and using basic logical
     reasoning.
*)
  intros P Q H PQ QnP.
(* We first introduce the universal quantifiers and the hypothesis H : P -> Q
     using the "intros" tactic.
*)
  apply H.
(* We then apply the hypothesis H to the negation of Q, which is QnP.
This
     corresponds to the application of the contrapositive, asserting that if ~Q is
     true, then ~P must also be true.
*)
  apply QnP.
(* Finally, we conclude the proof using the "ex_falso_quodlibet" theorem, which
     states that from a contradiction (False), we can derive any proposition P.
In
     this case, the contradiction is the assumption that both P and ~P are true,
     which we have derived by applying the contrapositive and the hypothesis H.
