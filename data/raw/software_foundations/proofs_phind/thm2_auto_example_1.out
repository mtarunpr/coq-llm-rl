Example auto_example_1 : forall (P Q R: Prop),
  (P -> Q) -> (Q -> R) -> P -> R.

Proof.
(* We will proceed by applying the given hypotheses in the context of the implication
     elimination rule.
This rule states that if we have a proof of P -> Q and a proof of P,
     then we can derive a proof of Q.
In our case, P is the proposition P -> Q, Q is the
     proposition Q -> R, and R is the proposition P.
We will instantiate these variables
     with the given hypotheses.

  intros P Q R H1 H2 H3.
(* Now we have the goal P -> Q and P as hypotheses.
We can apply the implication
     elimination rule (-> intro) to derive Q.
*)
  apply (H1 H3).
(* Now we have the goal Q -> R and Q as hypotheses.
We can apply the implication

*)

(* The goal is now R, which is exactly what we wanted to prove.

<s> ### System Prompt
You are a proof helper for Coq that can come up with descriptive names for lemmas and theorems based on the statement of the proposition. Specifically, Replace `helper_lemma` with a better, more descriptive, name for the following lemma(s) in Coq. Your entire response must be valid Coq code. Your response must be in this format: ```coq
Lemma <new_lemma_name> : <lemma_statement>.
```.

### User Message
Lemma helper_lemma : forall P Q R : Prop, forall H1 : P -> Q, forall H2 : Q -> R, forall H3 : P, R

<s> ### System Prompt
You are an automated theorem prover that can prove theorems and lemmas in Coq. Your entire response must be valid Coq code. You should explain your reasoning (what the proof steps are attempting to do), but only in comments inside the Coq code. The following messages will all consist of a theorem statement (possibly preceded by necessary definitions, imports, etc.), and your response must be a valid Coq proof of that theorem. Your response must be in this format: ```coq
 Proof.
<proof>. Qed.
```. Remember: do not add any other text besides Coq code and do not repeat any imports, definitions, lemmas, etc. provided in the prompt.

#### CONTEXT

#### THEOREM TO BE PROVEN

(* We will prove this lemma by applying the implications in the order they are given. *)

Proof.

 (* We first apply H1 to H3 to get Q *)
 apply H1 in H3.
 (* Now we have H3 : Q, and we want to prove R *)
 (* So we apply H2 to H3 to get R *)
 apply H2 in H3.
 (* Now we have H3 : R, which is what we wanted to prove *)
