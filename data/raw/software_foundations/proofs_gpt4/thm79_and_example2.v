Lemma and_example2 : forall n m : nat, n = 0 /\ m = 0 -> n + m = 0.

Proof.
(* Introduce the variables n and m, as well as the assumption that both are 0 *)
  intros n m [Hn Hm].
(* By knowing both n and m are 0, we can rewrite n and m to 0 in the goal *)
  rewrite Hn, Hm.
(* Now our goal is simplified to proving that 0 + 0 = 0, which is obvious *)
  reflexivity.
Qed.
