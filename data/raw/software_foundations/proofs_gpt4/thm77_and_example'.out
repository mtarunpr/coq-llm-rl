Example and_example' : 3 + 4 = 7 /\ 2 * 2 = 4.

Proof.
(* We prove this by applying the `and_intro` lemma, which requires two subgoals to be proven.
*)
  apply and_intro.
- (* Subgoal 1: We need to prove that 3 + 4 = 7.
This follows by reflexivity of equality, since Coq can compute the sum directly.
*)
    reflexivity.
- (* Subgoal 2: We need to prove that 2 * 2 = 4.
This also follows by reflexivity, again because Coq can compute the product directly.
*)
    reflexivity.
Qed.
