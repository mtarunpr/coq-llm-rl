Definition injective {A B} (f : A -> B) :=
  forall x y : A, f x = f y -> x = y.



Lemma succ_inj : injective S.

Proof.
unfold injective.
(* We unfold the definition of injective to work with it directly.
*)
  intros n m H.
(* Assume n and m are natural numbers and we have S n = S m.
*)
  inversion H.
(* Apply inversion to the hypothesis to conclude that n = m.
*)
  reflexivity.
(* Conclude the goal using reflexivity, since n = m.
*)

Qed.
