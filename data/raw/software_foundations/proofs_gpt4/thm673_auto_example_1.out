Example auto_example_1 : forall (P Q R: Prop),
  (P -> Q) -> (Q -> R) -> P -> R.

Proof.
(* We take all premises and hypotheses as given, and introduce them into the context.
*)
  intros P Q R H_PQ H_QR H_P.
(* We apply the implication H_PQ to the hypothesis H_P to deduce Q.
*)
  apply H_PQ in H_P.
(* Then we use the second implication H_QR with the derived Q to conclude R.
*)
  apply H_QR in H_P.
(* Finally, we conclude with R as the result, completing the proof.
*)
