Lemma contradicting_zero_one_equality_1 : forall H : forall x y1 y2 : nat,
x <= y1 -> x <= y2 -> y1 = y2, 0 = 1.

Proof.
(* Introduce the hypothesis H *)
  intro H.
(* Use the hypothesis H with x := 0, y1 := 0, and y2 := 1, and apply O_le_n to prove 0 <= 0 and 0 <= 1 *)
  specialize (H 0 0 1).

Lemma contradicting_zero_one_equality_2 : forall H : forall x y1 y2 : nat,
x <= y1 -> x <= y2 -> y1 = y2, 0 = 1.

Proof.
(* We will prove this by contradiction by applying the hypothesis H to
     specific values of x, y1, and y2, where y1 and y2 have distinct values
     that are both bounds for x.
This will lead us to a contradiction since
     we will deduce that two distinct numbers are equal.

  (* We introduce the hypothesis H to our context *)
  intros H.
(* We will use 0 as the value for x, 0 for y1, and 1 for y2.
According to H,
     if 0 <= 0 and 0 <= 1, then 0 = 1, which is a contradiction.

Lemma contradicting_zero_one_equality_3 : forall H : forall x y1 y2 : nat,
x <= y1 -> x <= y2 -> y1 = y2, 0 = 1.

Proof.
(* We will use the hypothesis H to derive a contradiction.
By instantiating H with the specific numbers 0 and 1 in different ways,
     we can cause it to give us contradictory statements.
*)
  
  intros H.
(* Apply the hypothesis H with x = 0, y1 = 0, y2 = 1.
Since 0 is less than or equal to both 0 and 1, H should yield that 0 = 1.
*)
  assert (E: 0 = 1) by apply (H 0 0 1); apply O_le_n.
(* Our assertion gives us direct evidence of a contradiction,
     which is enough to complete the proof.
