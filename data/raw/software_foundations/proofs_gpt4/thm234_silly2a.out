Theorem silly1 : forall (n m : nat),
  n = m ->
  n = m.
Proof.
  intros n m eq.



  apply eq.  Qed.



Theorem silly2 : forall (n m o p : nat),
  n = m ->
  (n = m -> [n;o] = [m;p]) ->
  [n;o] = [m;p].
Proof.
  intros n m o p eq1 eq2.
  apply eq2. apply eq1.  Qed.





Theorem silly2a : forall (n m : nat),
  (n,n) = (m,m)  ->
  (forall (q r : nat), (q,q) = (r,r) -> [q] = [r]) ->
  [n] = [m].

Proof.
(* Introduce the variables and hypotheses *)
  intros n m H Hq.
(* Apply the hypothesis Hq with n and m, knowing that (n, n) = (m, m) *)
  apply Hq.
