Theorem bin_nat_bin_fails : forall b, nat_to_bin (bin_to_nat b) = b.

Proof.
(* This theorem cannot be proven because it is not true; that is, the statement does not
   hold for all values of b.
Thus, we cannot construct a valid proof.
However, for the sake of this
   task, I will outline a strategy one might mistakenly attempt if they were trying to prove 
   the theorem without realizing it was false.
One might start from the definitions of `bin_to_nat` and `nat_to_bin`:
   1.
Use structural induction on `b`, considering the cases where `b` is `Z`, `B0 n`, or `B1 n`.
2.
For the base case where `b = Z`, `nat_to_bin (bin_to_nat Z) = nat_to_bin 0 = Z`.
3.
For the inductive cases, use the inductive hypothesis and the definitions of `incr` 
      and `double_bin` to attempt to show that `nat_to_bin (bin_to_nat (B0 n)) = B0 n` and 
      `nat_to_bin (bin_to_nat (B1 n)) = B1 n`.
However, this strategy would fail at some point because there are values of `b` for which
   `nat_to_bin (bin_to_nat b) â‰  b`, such as when `b` has trailing zeros, i.e., in forms like
   `B0 Z`, `B0 (B0 Z)`, etc., after applying `bin_to_nat` and then `nat_to_bin`, the trailing
   zeros would be lost.
Because of this discrepancy, the theorem `bin_nat_bin_fails` cannot be proven within Coq, and
   there isn't an actual proof to provide in Coq code.
