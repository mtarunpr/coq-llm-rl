Inductive ev : nat -> Prop :=
  | ev_0                       : ev 0
  | ev_SS (n : nat) (H : ev n) : ev (S (S n)).







Check ev_SS
  : forall n,
    ev n ->
    ev (S (S n)).





Theorem ev_4 : ev 4.
Proof.
  apply ev_SS. apply ev_SS. apply ev_0. Qed.



Print ev_4.




Check (ev_SS 2 (ev_SS 0 ev_0))
  : ev 4.







Theorem ev_4' : ev 4.

Proof.
(* We know ev_4 states ev 4 is provable.
Since ev_4' has the same goal, we can use it directly.
*)
  exact ev_4.
Qed.
