Theorem add_0_r_firsttry : forall n:nat,
  n + 0 = n.

Proof.
(* We apply the induction tactic to generate two subgoals:
     one for the base case when n = 0,
     and one for the inductive step where n = S n' for some n'.
*)
  induction n as [| n' IHn'].
- (* Base case: We must show that 0 + 0 = 0.
This follows directly from the definition of '+'.
*)
    reflexivity.
- (* Inductive step: We have the induction hypothesis IHn' that
       n' + 0 = n', and we must show that S n' + 0 = S n'.
We can simplify both sides of the equation using the definition of '+'.
*)
    simpl.
(* Simplifies to show S (n' + 0) = S n' *)
    rewrite IHn'.
(* Use the induction hypothesis to replace n' + 0 with n' *)
    reflexivity.
(* Both sides are now identical, completing the proof.
